# ethSNARKs for Emscripten / WebAssembly

This project is part of [ethsnarks](http://github.com/HarryR/ethsnarks), but targets WebAssembly by building ethsnarks and its dependencies using [Emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/index.html).

**WARNING: this is a work-in-progress, may be slow and isn't generally usable yet, but watch this space!**

## Building

Install the Emscripten SDK and run `source $EMSDK_HOME/emsdk_env.sh`

Then, to build this project, run `make`
